01) Bean
         In Spring, a bean is simply an object that is managed by Spring IOC container.(Inversion of Control)

02) Bean Scopes
          * Scope refers to the lifecycle of a bean.
          * Default scope is a singleton



03) Singleton
          * Spring Container creates only one instance of the bean, by default. (one instance means one object)
          * It is cached in memory.
          * All dependency injections for the bean.
