1) What is Spring Boot?
      *   Spring Boot is an open-source Java framework used to 
          create a Micro Service. 
      *   Spring boot is developed by Pivotal Team, and it provides
          a faster way to set up and an easier, configure, 
          and run both simple and web-based applications. 
      *   It is a combination of Spring Framework and 
          Embedded Servers. 
      *   The main goal of Spring Boot is to reduce development, 
          unit test, and integration test time and in Spring Boot, 
          there is no requirement for XML configuration.

2) Spring-boot-Starter
      * spring-boot-starter is a core dependency in Spring Boot applications.
          It provides essential features like auto-configuration, logging 
          and YAML support.

          What it enables you to do Once added, you can:
              * Create REST controllers using @RestController
              * Handle HTTP requests with @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.
              * Automatically start a web server when you run your application
          EX :-
               <dependency>
                    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
               </dependency>


3) Application.properties
     The application.properties file is a central configuration file used to define
     various application settings, including database connectivity.
                                   or
     The application.properties file in a Spring boot project is a configuration
     file used to define various settings and behaviours of your application. It allows
     you to customize how your spring boot app runs without changing the code.

     Ex :-
        application.properties file              DempApp.java
        ------------------------------          --------------------------------
        |  #configure server port    |          | @RestController              |
        | server.port=8080           |          | public class DemoApp{        |
        |                            |          |    @Value("${coach.name}")   |
        |  #configure my props       |          |     private String c         |
        |  coach.name=Balu           |          |                              |
        |  team.name=The BBS Crew    |          |                              |
